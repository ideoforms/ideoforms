### ideoforms / Daniel John Jones

I am a UK-based artist-researcher, interested in algorithmic composition, sonification, systems music, sound installations, and spatial audio.

As part of my practice, I develop a number of open-source frameworks that are focused on generating and interacting with sound, primarily via Python.

- ðŸŽ› [signalflow](https://github.com/ideoforms/signalflow): real-time sound synthesis, processing and DSP, with Pythonic API and an efficient C++ core
- ðŸŽµ [isobar](https://github.com/ideoforms/isobar): generate and manipulate musical patterns and control sequences, outputting MIDI, OSC, or MIDI files
- ðŸŽ¹ [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC): enables control of [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/shop/live/) with OpenSoundControl
- ðŸ”Œ [pylive](https://github.com/ideoforms/pylive): connects to AbletonOSC to control [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/shop/live/) directly from Python scripts 
- ðŸ”Š [python-supercollider](https://github.com/ideoforms/python-supercollider): control the [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) synthesis engine from Python
