### ideoforms / Daniel Jones

I am a UK-based artist-researcher, interested in algorithmic composition, sonification, systems music, and spatial sound installations.

These open-source frameworks are mostly focused on generating and interacting with sound, primarily with Python. 🐍🔊

- 🎵 [isobar](isobar): generate and manipulate musical patterns and control sequences, outputting MIDI, OSC, or MIDI files
- 🎛 [signalflow](signalflow): real-time sound synthesis, processing and DSP
- 🎹 [AbletonOSC](AbletonOSC): control [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/shop/live/) with OpenSoundControl
- ⚡ [pylive](pylive): connects to AbletonOSC to control [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/shop/live/) direct from Python scripts 
- ⚛ [python-supercollider](python-supercollider): control the [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) synthesis engine from Python
